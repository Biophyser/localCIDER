{"name":"LocalCIDER","tagline":"LocalCIDER is the Python backend for CIDER","body":"### LocalCIDER lets you do [almost] everything CIDER does, locally!\r\n\r\nCIDER [Classification of Intrinsically Disordered Ensemble Regions](http://pappulab.wustl.edu/CIDER) is a webserver for calculating various properties of a disordered sequence. CIDER's computation is primarily done by a backend app, which we call LocalCIDER.\r\n\r\nCIDER is useful if you want to quickly calculate some parameter on the fly. HOWEVER, for doing a huge range of sequences, we recommend you instead use LocalCIDER and carry out the computation locally.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why LocalCIDER\r\nLocalCIDER lets us provide an implicit distributed computing model to all of CIDER's calculations. Think of it this way - if 100 people have 100 sequences, we (the Pappu lab) have the burden of 10,000 calculations to perform. If everyone submitted these sequences at once, the website would slow for everyone, and maybe crash. This is a lot of work for us, and very annoying for you, the user. HOWEVER, by using LocalCIDER you can take advantage of\r\n\r\n* Your own local infrastructure\r\n* Programatically create analysis pipelines\r\n* Operate independently of the CIDER webserver\r\n\r\n\r\n## How do I use it\r\nLocalCIDER will (*VERY SOON*) be available as a PyPI package. That means that using [PIP](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) (and to be clear, if you're using Python and not using pip, you're doing it wrong) getting LocalCIDER is a single command\r\n\r\n    [sudo] pip install localCIDER\r\n\r\n\r\nok\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
