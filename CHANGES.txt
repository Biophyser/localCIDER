0.1.8
* The kappa-P (proline/charge patterning) parameter has been added. This is used in the upcoming paper by Martin and Holehouse (reference to come). 

* Three different sequence complexity measures have been added: Wooton-Federhen complexity [8], Linguistic complexity [9], Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) complexity [10]. These algorithms have a number of parameters which can be defined, as well as the ability to use a set of pre-defined reduced alphabetes [11]

* Overall PPII propensity can be calculated based on the amino acid PPII propensity as defined by Elam *et al.* [6].

* All figures can now be saved as PDFs (useful for post-process with graphics tools, e.g. Adobe Illustrator)

* The bar positions for blob-based figures have been updated such that bin centers are used on all figures. This makes comparing figures using different blob-widths much easier.

* Numpy vectors of the linear NCPR, FCR, hydropathy and sequence complexity can now be directly returned for further analysis 

* Sequences can be directly converted to a reduced alphabet sequence. The mapping of true amino-acid alphabet to reduced alphabet can take advantage of 11 predefined mappings, or this mapping can be defined using a custom dictionary.

* localCIDER can now run under Python 3
