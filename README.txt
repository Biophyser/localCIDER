localCIDER
==========

localCIDER is the Python backend for CIDER, and provides a set of tools for both calculating and plotting a wide range of parameters associated with disordered proteins and regions.

Specifically, this project was motivated by the need to rapidly and easily calculate the kappa parameter, as defined in the 2013 Das & Pappu PNAS paper, "Conformations of intrinsically disordered proteins are influenced by linear sequence distributions of oppositely charged residues". 

Beyond kappa, localCIDER lets you calculate a range of additional parameters, as well as create the Pappu-Das phase diagram.

To install run

    [sudo] pip install localcider

localCIDER was written by Alex Holehouse and James Ahad in the `Pappu Lab <http://pappulab.wustl.edu/`_ .
